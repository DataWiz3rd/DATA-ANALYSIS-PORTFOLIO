# Caroline Otuneye - Data-Analysis-Portfolio
# About
I’m Caroline, a Chemical Engineering enthusiast with a love for making sense of data. My journey into data analytics started with tools like MATLAB, Excel, and SQL, and I’ve also picked up some Python along the way. I believe my engineering background gives me a unique edge when it comes to solving problems and finding patterns in complex datasets.

One of my proudest achievements was during my time as Membership Chairperson for the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPEOAU). I worked on analyzing and organizing membership data, and my efforts led to a 30% increase in membership within just a month! It felt amazing to see how data-driven decisions could make such a big impact.

I’ve also had the chance to participate in a MATLAB competition, which taught me how powerful computational tools can be for breaking down tough problems. Those experiences made me realize how much I enjoy digging into data, finding insights, and using them to drive meaningful change.

This portfolio is a collection of my projects and skills. It’s my way of showing how I’ve applied tools like MATLAB, Excel, and SQL to real-world scenarios and how I’m growing in the field of data analytics.

I’m excited about the future and can’t wait to take on a data analyst role where I can bring my skills, curiosity, and passion for problem-solving to the table. Feel free to look around my portfolio.

I’d love to connect and chat more about data, engineering, or anything in between!
